Focus of this one was creating every asset
Learned how to make tilesets create interactive tiles, made a lot of sprites, player animation, made sounds and some music.
Everything except the font was made by me

Tried to recreate the movement of the original Super Mario, with the player sliding a little so you have to be careful.
Player controllers works fine, the implementation in code is a bit rough with a lot of functions and if statements,
it being my first platformer without following any guide. Tt still taught me a lot
